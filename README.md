# Minecraft Shaders Information

In the 1.17 snapshot 21w10a, more shader types were added for resource packs to be able to edit. As the gameâ€™s OpenGL version was upgraded, more possibilities were added for customisable shaders. This is a repo which attempts to record and document each of the new core shader types, what they do, and general information about core shaders.
