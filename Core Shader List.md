# Non-Rendertype
There are several shaders which are not prefixed with `rendertype_`. These seem to be for more general targets, such as the sky or all particles.  

### blit_screen  
Blit copies one buffer to another, however this cannot be overridden in a resource pack. 

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### particle  
All particles. The alpha value specified in the shader will override the particleâ€™s inbuilt transparency e.g. in the sneeze particle. Others, like the splash particle, don't seem to allow this. More testing needed.

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### position
The colour of the sky. Also affects text highlighting. 

[Back to Top](#contents)

---

### position_color
Handles a few different things:
* The black transparent background on UI elements such as the chat field or the pause menu,
* The Mojang loading background,
* Highlighting item slots,
* The background of tooltips,
* The transparent lower hemisphere overlay on the sky approximately between times 11315 to 14150 (sunset) and 21830 to 24670 (sunrise),
* The black bars on the sides when scoped in with a spyglass.

For UI elements, Position is the screen size divided by the GUI scale. E.g. 1920x1080 with GUI scale 3 means Position for x will be [0,640] and for y [0,360].

### position_tex
Handles a few different things:
* The Sun and Moon,
* The worldborder, 
* Most GUI textures (like the hotbar, buttons), 
* Overlays (pumpkin blur, powder snow, the vignette),
* The crosshair.

# Rendertype
These are shaders which are targeted towards a specific element of the display.
**For each shader name here, assume that it is prefixed with `rendertype_`.**

## Blocks
When dealing with block shaders which have something to do with `translucent`, `cutout` or `cutout_mipped`, here is a [useful list](List%20of%20Blocks%20Affected.md) for all blocks of those specific types.

[Back to Top](#contents)


### solid
All solid blocks, lava, and when in fast mode, leaves. Also affects non-translucent falling blocks.

### entity_translucent
Translucent entities and parts of entities: slimes, players (except lower layer of the arm in first person) and player heads, markings on horses, shulker bullets, elder guardian particle effect. Sampler1 contains the red color that is overlayed on entities when they take damage.

### entity_solid
Certain entities or entity-style objects: the base of banners, shulker heads, books on lecterns/enchantment tables, shields, beds, bell part of bells, capes, shells of conduits, paintings, tridents, the ears on the Deadmau5 skin.
With item frames, the item frame entity itself is part of the shader, however items on it are not. Only the filled in parts of maps placed on an item frame are part of the shader.
Also includes the first person bottom skin layer and the conduit item (in inventory).

### water_mask
Hides the water in a boat. Changing the color does not seem to have an effect, but changing the position does. Pictured left is moving the mask down by 64, pictured right is moving it to the right by 2.

## UI
These are shaders which affect some part of the UI. This is currently just text, as most UI elements are rendered by [Non-Rendertype](#non-rendertype) shaders.

### text
All parts of text, including the shadow. This encompasses all text rendered including: F3 Menu, Menu button text, Entity names, Item names, descriptions & amounts in the inventory and the Chat etc. It also does the explored parts of maps

#### Isolating Elements
Isolating certain texts. Different types of text can be isolated using their Position.z. Texts without a shadow are located at x, texts with a shadow are located at x + 0.03 with their shadow being at x. (e.g. at 0.0 and 0.03). A basic list of where which text is located:
-200: Advancement menu text
0: Most gui text
100: Chat display
200: Item count in hotbar
300: Item count in inventory
400: Item count while dragging item, tooltip texts
0 to 104: Maps (not actually text)

Since maps share the z value with the chat display and a part of the hotbar item count, you can test for Sampler0 having a size of 128 pixels in both directions to test for the face being a map.

### text_see_through

## Other
These are shaders that render things that aren't clearly either a block, an entity or a ui element.

### lines
Handles a few different things:
* The outline when hovering over a block,
* The debug crosshair,
* The f3+B hitbox displays,
* The f3+G chunk border displays,
* Previews in the structure block.
